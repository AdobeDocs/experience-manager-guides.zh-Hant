From the "Generate PDF using" menu, choose FrameMaker Publishing Server.

The user can provide "Settings File(.sts)" and "ditaval. Filtering will be done using Ditaval based on the conditions you supply.

-   **Setting file**: FrameMaker /FMPS Publish setting which contains all those settings which you want FMPS to honour while publishing For example: ,Generating output with customised template ,Generating Marks and Bleeds(PDF) , Generating PDF with TOC , index etc .
-   **FMPS present:** Pre-defined combination of Ditaval and Settings file , Instead of giving separate Ditaval and settings file , User can pre-create FMPS preset which can be re-used for publishing need.

**Note:**  If you don’t select any of Settings or FMPS Preset then FMPS will publish with default system setting.

If you have selected FMPS Preset and also provided Settings/Ditaval file from AEM then this will conflict and FMPS Preset will be given precedence over custom Settings/Ditaval file.
